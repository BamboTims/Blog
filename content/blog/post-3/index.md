(CNN) - A single moment can change the trajectory of our lives. For Nigerian Iyeneobong “Iyene” Essien, that moment came when she was just five years old. She remembers the day her dad took her to a golf course in Abuja, where she saw a boy teeing off. Intrigued by the sight, she asked her dad if she could pursue the sport.

>“(My father) was pretty surprised by my question,” she said.“He asked me if I really wanted to play this sport and I said, ‘yes,’ and he got me a coach and I started playing golf.”

The rest was history.

Essien entered her first competition the same year and proved to be a natural, placing first in her age group. “I found that really cool,” she said.

By age 11, the golfer was representing Nigeria at international competitions across the US, UK, and Africa including Morocco, Botswana, and South Africa. Now 16, she is the No.1 ranked junior girls’ golfer in Nigeria and has won more than a dozen trophies after placing in various competitions.

In late July, Essien clinched second place in the Under 19 Girls division at the [Champion of Champions World Championship](https://mpg-championofchampionsworldchampionship.golfgenius.com/pages/8032774274659926385) in Northern Ireland. “It was a really good experience for me,” she said. Finishing five strokes behind first, Essein says she is proud of how she played.

“Everything happens for a reason – even though you come second or third, it means that you’re getting closer and closer to first,” she said, noting the experience of playing on a world-renowned course was a win in itself. “The fact that I could play on the same course as Rory Mcllroy played on and be in the same vicinity of all that history was really very important to me.”
